# Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
========================================================

In fact, the train and the test data sets are "one" thing. They are just split so as to form two groups of data, one which is the "train" data set to be used for example in "training" an algorithm and the "test" data set which is used to check, probably for accuracy, the results of the algorithm ran on the the "train". This is how I see this data set.
