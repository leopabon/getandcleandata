The tidy.txt file has the solution for steps 1-5 of the course project. This data set sumarizes the mean of each measure of the 79 samsung data related to mean and std agregated by activity and subject.

It has 2 dimensions for the identification of the subject and the activity measured.

* Activity - Describes the activity performed by the subject. The acivities avaiable are: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying.
* Subject - Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

It has 79 measures related to the mean and std measures in the original 561 Samsung measures.
